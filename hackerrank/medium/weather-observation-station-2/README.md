where *LAT\_N* is the northern latitude and *LONG\_W* is the western longitude.

**Constraints**

 

**Output Format**

Your results must be in the form:

	lat lon
    
where $lat$ is the sum of all values in *LAT\_N* and $lon$ is the sum of all values in *LONG\_W*. Both results must be rounded to a scale of $2$ decimal places.
