## Problem

### Make Multiple

You are given an integer $N$.

In one operation, you can modify $N$ as follows:

- Add $1$ to $N$, or
- Replace $N$ with the nearest multiple of $5$ that's strictly larger than $N$.

For example,

- If $N = 24$, the nearest multiple of $5$ that's strictly larger than it is $25$.
- If $N = 45$, the nearest multiple of $5$ that's strictly larger than it is $50$.

Your goal is to make $N$ become divisible by $3$.

Find the  **minimum**  number of operations needed.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing a single integer $N$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the answer: the minimum number of operations needed.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq N \leq 100$
### Sample 1:

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  We start with $N = 1$. One solution using two operations is as follows:

- Replace $N$ with the next multiple of $5$. This turns $N$ into $5$.
- Then add $1$ to $N$, making it $6$. $N$ is now a multiple of $3$, as desired.

It can be verified that using fewer than two operations is not enough to make $N$ a multiple of $3$.

 **Test case $2$:**  We start with $N = 2$. Add $1$ to make it $3$, which is a multiple of $3$. The answer is hence $1$.

 **Test case $3$:**  We start with $N = 3$. This is already a multiple of $3$, so no operations are needed and the answer is $0$.

 **Test case $4$:**  We start with $N = 10$. Replace it with the next multiple of $5$, which is $15$. This is a multiple of $3$, so we're done in one operation.

            // Option 2: Jump to the next multiple of 5
            int next5 = ((N / 5) + 1) * 5;

            int operations = 1 + (next5 % 3);

            ans = Math.min(ans, operations);

            System.out.println(ans);
		}

	}
